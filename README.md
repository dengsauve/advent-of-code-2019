# Advent of Code - 2019
My code used to solve the problems in Advent of Code, 2019.

# Notes on each challenge

## Day 01

This was a fairly simple challeng - get the fuel needed for the cargo modules, then get the fuel needed for the fuel.
I took a recursive approach to solving fuel for fuel.

## Day 02

This one was a little more difficult just because there was so much going on on the challenge page story wise.
The gist was to create a parser for intcode program input. 

I took my sweet time on part two, and b/c I skipped the last line

>What is 100 * noun + verb? (For example, if noun=12 and verb=2, the answer would be 1202.)

I had some trouble submitting my answer for part two b/c I didn't format it correctly.
